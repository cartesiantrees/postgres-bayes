Using Bayesian models in PostgreSQL


# Description

This repo does the exhaustive analysis of the theoretical foundations of **Bayesian Theorem** and its potential adaptation to a relational database environment, specifically **PostgreSQL**.

We focus most on the development of specialized algorithms tailored to efficiently implement Bayesian reasoning within the database architecture. These algorithms were designed to handle the intricacies of large action models, ensuring scalability and computational efficiency.
