# Gibbs Sampling Algorithm

## Introduction
Gibbs Sampling is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that generates samples from the joint distribution of multiple variables by iteratively sampling from their conditional distributions. This process allows for sampling from complex and high-dimensional distributions where direct sampling is difficult.

### Key Concepts
- **Conditional Sampling**: Gibbs Sampling involves iteratively sampling from the conditional distributions of each variable given the current values of the other variables.
- **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**: Gibbs Sampling is a type of MCMC method that constructs a Markov chain to sample from the target distribution.
- **Bayesian Inference**: Gibbs Sampling is commonly used in Bayesian inference to sample from the posterior distribution of parameters when direct sampling is infeasible.

### Applications
- **Bayesian Inference**: Gibbs Sampling is widely used in Bayesian data analysis to sample from complex posterior distributions.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Gibbs Sampling is employed in various statistical models where the joint distribution is difficult to sample from directly.
- **Machine Learning**: Gibbs Sampling is used in machine learning algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling.

## Pseudocode
The pseudocode for the Gibbs Sampling algorithm is as follows:

```
Initialize variables X and Y
Repeat for a specified number of iterations:
    Sample X from the conditional distribution P(X|Y)
    Sample Y from the conditional distribution P(Y|X)
    Store the sampled values of X and Y
```

In each iteration, X is sampled from the conditional distribution of X given Y, and Y is sampled from the conditional distribution of Y given X. This process generates samples from the joint distribution of X and Y.

## Example
Suppose we want to sample from a bivariate normal distribution with known means, variances, and correlation. We can use Gibbs Sampling to generate samples from the joint distribution of the two variables.

### Initialization
- Initialize X and Y to arbitrary starting values.

### Iterative Sampling
- In each iteration:
    - Sample X from the conditional distribution of X given Y.
    - Sample Y from the conditional distribution of Y given X.
    - Store the sampled values of X and Y.

### Conditional Distributions
The conditional distributions for a bivariate normal distribution are:
- X|Y ~ Normal(μx + ρσx (Y - μy)/σy, σx√(1 - ρ^2))

## Overview
The Gibbs Sampling algorithm is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method used to sample from the joint distribution of multiple variables when direct sampling is difficult. It is particularly useful for high-dimensional distributions and in Bayesian inference where the posterior distributions are complex.

## Implementation
This implementation demonstrates Gibbs Sampling for a bivariate normal distribution with known means, variances, and correlation. The algorithm iteratively samples from the conditional distributions of each variable, given the other.

### Key Concepts
- **Conditional Sampling**: At each step, one variable is sampled given the current value of the other, leveraging the conditional distributions derived from the joint distribution.
- **Bivariate Normal Distribution**: The example assumes a bivariate normal distribution for simplicity, but Gibbs Sampling can be applied to more complex and higher-dimensional distributions.

### Example Output:

The first few samples are shown, demonstrating the algorithm's ability to generate samples from the joint distribution of XX and YY. The output provides a glimpse into the nature of the sampled values, reflecting the specified means, variances, and correlation.
Further Analysis:

For practical applications or deeper analysis, one might:
- **Plot the Samples**: Visualizing the samples in a scatter plot can help illustrate the joint distribution and the correlation between XX and YY. 
- **Compute Summary Statistics**: Calculating the empirical means, variances, and correlation from the samples can offer insights into the accuracy and efficiency of the Gibbs Sampling process.
- **Assess Convergence**: Analyzing the trace plots for each variable or employing more sophisticated convergence diagnostics can ensure that the sampling process has stabilized and is providing reliable estimates from the desired distribution.

This implementation serves as a foundational example of Gibbs Sampling, illustrating the method's utility in sampling from complex joint distributions through conditional sampling strategies


## Usage
The `gibbs_sampling` function takes the means (`mu_x`, `mu_y`), standard deviations (`sigma_x`, `sigma_y`), correlation coefficient (`rho`), and the number of iterations (`n_iterations`) as inputs to generate samples from the joint distribution.

```python
samples = gibbs_sampling(mu_x=0, mu_y=0, sigma_x=1, sigma_y=1, rho=0.5, n_iterations=10000)
```


```python
import numpy as np

def gibbs_sampling(mu_x, mu_y, sigma_x, sigma_y, rho, n_iterations):
    samples = np.zeros((n_iterations, 2))
    x, y = 0, 0  # Initial values
    for i in range(n_iterations):
        # Sample X from the conditional distribution of X given Y
        x = np.random.normal(mu_x + rho * sigma_x / sigma_y * (y - mu_y), sigma_x * np.sqrt(1 - rho**2))
        # Sample Y from the conditional distribution of Y given X
        y = np.random.normal(mu_y + rho * sigma_y / sigma_x * (x - mu_x), sigma_y * np.sqrt(1 - rho**2))
        samples[i] = [x, y]
    return samples

# Example Usage
samples = gibbs_sampling(mu_x=0, mu_y=0, sigma_x=1, sigma_y=1, rho=0.5, n_iterations=10000)
print(samples[:5])
```

# Random Forest Algorithm

## Introduction
Random Forest is a popular ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to create a more robust and accurate model. It is widely used for both classification and regression tasks due to its simplicity, flexibility, and high performance.

## Key Concepts
- **Ensemble Learning**: Random Forest builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the model.
- **Decision Trees**: The base learners in a Random Forest are decision trees, which are simple, interpretable models that recursively partition the feature space.
- **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**: Random Forest uses a technique called bagging to create multiple subsets of the training data and train individual decision trees on each subset.
- **Random Feature Selection**: In addition to using random subsets of the training data, Random Forest also randomly selects a subset of features at each split to reduce correlation between trees.
- **Voting or Averaging**: For classification tasks, Random Forest uses a majority voting scheme to determine the final class, while for regression tasks, it averages the predictions of individual trees.

## Algorithm
The Random Forest algorithm can be summarized as follows:
1. Randomly select n samples with replacement from the training data (bootstrap sample).
2. Randomly select m features from the total feature set.
3. Build a decision tree using the selected samples and features.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 to create a forest of decision trees.
5. For classification tasks, use a majority voting scheme to determine the final class. For regression tasks, average the predictions of individual trees.

## Example
Suppose we have a dataset of flower species with features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. We can use a Random Forest classifier to predict the species of a flower based on these features.

### Initialization
- Initialize the number of trees in the forest (n_trees), the maximum depth of each tree (max_depth), and the number of features to consider at each split (max_features).

### Training
- For each tree in the forest:
    - Create a bootstrap sample of the training data.
    - Randomly select a subset of features.
    - Build a decision tree using the bootstrap sample and selected features.

### Prediction
- For a new data point:
    - Make predictions using each tree in the forest.
    - For classification tasks, use majority voting to determine the final class. For regression tasks, average the predictions.

# Gradient Boosting Algorithm

## Introduction
Gradient Boosting is a powerful ensemble learning method that builds a series of decision trees sequentially, with each tree learning from the errors of its predecessor. It is widely used for both regression and classification tasks due to its high performance and flexibility.

## Key Concepts
- **Boosting**: Gradient Boosting is a type of boosting algorithm that combines multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to create a strong learner.
- **Gradient Descent**: The algorithm minimizes a loss function by iteratively fitting new models to the negative gradient of the loss function.
- **Residual Learning**: Each new tree in the sequence learns to predict the residual errors of the previous trees, gradually reducing the overall error.
- **Shrinkage (Learning Rate)**: Gradient Boosting introduces a learning rate parameter that scales the contribution of each tree, preventing overfitting and improving generalization.
- **Regularization**: To prevent overfitting, Gradient Boosting uses techniques such as tree depth constraints, minimum samples per leaf, and random feature selection.

## Algorithm
The Gradient Boosting algorithm can be summarized as follows:
1. Initialize the model with a constant value (e.g., the mean of the target variable).
2. For each iteration (n_trees):
    - Compute the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the predicted values.
    - Fit a regression tree to the negative gradient (residuals).
    - Update the model by adding the predictions of the new tree scaled by the learning rate.
3. Repeat the process for the specified number of iterations.
4. For regression tasks, the final prediction is the sum of the predictions from all trees. For classification tasks, the final prediction is obtained using a probability function (e.g., sigmoid for binary classification).

## Example
Suppose we have a dataset of housing prices with features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. We can use a Gradient Boosting regressor to predict the price of a house based on these features.

### Initialization
- Initialize the number of trees in the sequence (n_trees), the learning rate (eta), and the maximum depth of each tree (max_depth).

### Training
- For each iteration in the sequence:
    - Compute the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the predicted values.
    - Fit a regression tree to the negative gradient (residuals).
    - Update the model by adding the predictions of the new tree scaled by the learning rate.

### Prediction

- **Majority Voting**: For classification tasks, KNN predicts the class label of a new data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors. For regression tasks, it calculates the average of the target values of the k nearest neighbors.
- **Hyperparameters**: The key hyperparameter in KNN is the number of neighbors (k), which determines the size of the neighborhood used for classification or regression.

## Algorithm
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm can be summarized as follows:
1. Store the training data.
2. For a new data point:
    - Calculate the distance between the new data point and each training data point.
    - Identify the k nearest neighbors based on the distance metric.
    - For classification tasks, assign the majority class label among the k nearest neighbors to the new data point. For regression tasks, calculate the average of the target values of the k nearest neighbors.

## Example

# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes in the feature space, maximizing the margin between the classes.

## Key Concepts
- **Hyperplane**: In SVM, the hyperplane is a decision boundary that separates the classes in the feature space. The goal is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes.
- **Support Vectors**: Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the hyperplane and influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane.
- **Kernel Trick**: SVM can use a kernel function to map the input features into a higher-dimensional space, making the data linearly separable in that space.
- **Regularization Parameter (C)**: The regularization parameter (C) controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification error.
- **Soft Margin**: In cases where the data is not linearly separable, SVM uses a soft margin that allows for misclassification of some data points to improve generalization.

## Algorithm
The Support Vector Machine algorithm can be summarized as follows:
1. Initialize the hyperplane (decision boundary) that separates the classes.
2. Find the support vectors (data points closest to the hyperplane).
3. Optimize the hyperplane to maximize the margin between the classes.
4. For non-linearly separable data, use a kernel function to map the data into a higher-dimensional space.
5. Tune the regularization parameter (C) to control the trade-off between margin maximization and misclassification.

The principal components are eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data, and the eigenvalues represent the variance explained by each principal component.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA selects a subset of principal components that capture most of the variance in the data, reducing the dimensionality of the data.
- **Variance Retention**: PCA aims to retain as much variance as possible in the data while reducing the dimensionality.
- **Data Reconstruction**: PCA can reconstruct the original data from the reduced-dimensional representation by projecting the data back into the original feature space.
- **Applications**: PCA is commonly used for data visualization, feature extraction, and noise reduction in machine learning tasks.
- **Scree Plot**: A scree plot is a graphical representation of the eigenvalues of the principal components, showing the variance explained by each component.
- **Explained Variance Ratio**: The explained variance ratio is the proportion of variance explained by each principal component relative to the total variance in the data.
- **Cumulative Variance Ratio**: The cumulative variance ratio is the cumulative sum of the explained variance ratios, indicating the total variance explained by the selected principal components.
